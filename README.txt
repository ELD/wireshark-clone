Name: Eric Dattore
Project: Wireshark Clone

Instructions: Just type 'make' and the executable should be built and copied to your current directory.
To run the program, just put a valid capture as the argument to the project (i.e. ./wireshark-clone [capture]).

This project uses the Rust language and the compiler toolchain in my home directory. It should work for you, but if it doesn't, let me know.
It's likely a permissions issue in my home directory. It does build on Isengard and it does build on my personal machine, so any deviations
should just be permissions problems.
